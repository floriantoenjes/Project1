##Guess How Many Are In The Jar Game

Treehouse Java Web Development Techdegree Project 1

This project is about a guessing game. A jar is filled with a random amount of items of a certain type. The player has
to guess this amount until he wins the game by making the right guess.

The game is realized as a console based version. It provides an administrator setup to enter the type of item in the
jar and how many of those items fit into the jar. The number of guesses of the player is counted and on winning
the game the player is presented a score based on the difficulty of the guess and his guess count.
